        In the future, we plan to bring new features to Grow With Us! Some things that we are working on are allowing users
        to upload their own images to be animated during the timers. We also want to include resources for studying and
        breaks to help out our users. We will also incorporate an option where we will show our users previews of all
        our different plants, and they can choose which one they want to grow!
