    <h5>
        Time your studying with our website Grow With Us! Between 1 hour intervals of
        concentrated studying comes a relaxing 20 minutes animation of a growing plant.
        Research shows that a relaxing break, anywhere between 15-20 minutes, can increase
        productivity by letting your brain disengage without entirely losing the momentum
        of your work. For most, the brain can only truly focus for about an hour before
        needing a break.
